## Abstract 
Star formation in galaxies is regulated by turbulence, outflows, gas heating and cloud dispersal
– processes which depend sensitively on the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) into which
supernovae (SNe) explode. Unfortunately, direct measurements of ISM environments around SNe
remain scarce, as SNe are rare and often distant. Here we demonstrate a new approach: mapping
the ISM around the massive stars that are soon to explode. This provides a much larger census of
explosion sites than possible with only SNe, and allows comparison with sensitive, high-resolution maps
of the atomic and molecular gas from the Jansky VLA and ALMA. In the well-resolved Local Group
spiral M33, we specifically observe the environments of red supergiants (RSGs, progenitors of Type II
SNe), Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs, tracing stars >30M⊙, and possibly future stripped-envelope SNe), and
supernova remnants (SNRs, locations where SNe have exploded). We find that massive stars evolve
not only in dense, molecular-dominated gas (with younger stars in denser gas), but also a substantial
fraction (∼45% of WRs; higher for RSGs) evolve in lower-density, atomic-gas-dominated, inter-cloud
media. We show that these measurements are consistent with expectations from different stellar-age
tracer maps, and can be useful for validating SN feedback models in numerical simulations of galaxies.
Along with the discovery of a 20-pc diameter molecular gas cavity around a WR, these findings reemphasize the importance of pre-SN/correlated-SN feedback evacuating the dense gas around massive
stars before explosion, and the need for high-resolution (down to pc-scale) surveys of the multi-phase
ISM in nearby galaxies.
